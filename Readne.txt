This is a web development project I used to practice the web development skills I learned after taking online coding courses at CodeSchool.com (Now merged with Pluralsight) on and off for a year.

This is my first attempt to build my own website. For this project I decided to make a travel photoblog, with pictures from the different countries I've visited during my late teens and early 20's including Japan, New Zealand, and Jamaica. It makes use of HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap v.3. It also makes use of several Javascript plug-ins I included for some of the extra effects that make use of animations and lightboxes. I also built in a sliding carousel in an attempt to challenge myself. I made it to be responsive and viewable on all screen sizes and devices. 

It took me about a month to put together. While not perefect, I consider it a decent first attempt and I learned a lot in tthe process, and all in all I'm quite proud of it.
